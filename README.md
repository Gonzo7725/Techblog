# Techblog

## Description

This week we were challenged to create a Techblog that provides a content management system to run it. Users can log in, upload posts, edit and or delete posts and also leave comments on posts. People not signed up to the Techblog can only view other users posts. Techblog is a full stack web application built using the Model View Controller design paradigm. It uses MySQL and Sequelize for model definition and interaction and Handlebars.js for the front end, and Express.js for the backend. 

## Installation 

-git clone the repository to your local machine
-npm run seed to seed database
-npm start will run the application
-navigate to localhost:3001


## Usage

The app has been deployed through Heroku.
